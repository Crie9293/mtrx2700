# Code Information & Instructions
## Excercise 1
### 1.a
This code functions by converting a predefined string to either uppercase or lowercase determined by a value stored in R2.
```
.data
ascii_string: .asciz "Hello!"
.text
main:
    LDR  R1, =ascii_string   @ R1 points to the string
    MOV  R2, #0              @ Conversion mode: 0 = convert to lowercase; non-0 = convert to uppercase

```
Once the string (stored in R1) and the conversion mode (stored R2) is determined, the code loops through each letter in the string, detects if its lowercase and uppercase then changes the value accordingly before ending.
```
@ Mode non-zero: convert lowercase to uppercase
CMP  R4, #'a'
BLT  store_char
CMP  R4, #'z'
BGT  store_char
SUB  R4, R4, #32       @ Convert to uppercase
```
```
@ Mode zero: convert uppercase to lowercase
CMP  R4, #'A'
BLT  store_char
CMP  R4, #'Z'
BGT  store_char
ADD  R4, R4, #32
```
The value of the upper and lower case letters in an ascii table have a difference of 32 which is why we subtract / add the registers by 32, depending on the mode.

### 1.b
The goal of this code is to check if a given word is a palindrome. To do this, it is initially assumed that word *is* a palindrome, before iterating both forward and backwards through the word and checking if the letters match. If not, the word is not a palindrome. 
```
check_palindrome:
    CMP R4, R2
    BCS done			@check if iterations cross

    LDRB R5, [R4]		
    LDRB R6, [R2]
    CMP R5, R6			@check if start and back of word is same
    BNE not_palindrome

    ADD R4, R4, #1		
    SUB R2, R2, #1		@iterate forwards and back
    B check_palindrome
```
To simultaneously iterate forward and backward, we define 2 pointers using registers R4 and R2 and compare them at each iteration.

Example input and output,
Input: racecar
Output: 1 (Palindrome)

Input: hello
Output: 0 (Not a Palindrome)

### 1.c
This code implements a caeser cypher on the ascii string stored in R1. The code then completes a forwards or backwards cypher by the specified amount by loading a positive or negative number into R2 respectively.
For example
```
.data
ascii_string: .asciz "Hi"

.text
main:
    LDR R1,=ascii_string
    MOV R2,#3
```
The above code with cypher 'Hi" to 'Kl'.

It accomplishes this by iterating through each character and adding the cypher value until the end of the word is reached. However if the cypher reaches too far it must wrap around using the following code:
```
BranchFwd:
	SUB R3, R3, #26	@go to start of alphabet
	B Iterate

BranchBkwd:
	ADD R3, R3, #26	@go to end of alphabet
	B Iterate
```
The new cyphered ascii string is stored in R3

## Exercise 2
### 2.a
For this exercise, we simply perform a bitmask operation on the GPIO registers of the LED.



### 2.b
To add the amount of LEDs that lit up when the button is pressed, we first need to initialise the correct GPIOs.
```
BL enable_peripheral_clocks
BL initialise_discovery_board
```
Here, we are simply enabling the GPIOs for the discovery board user button and LED (GPIOA & GPIOE). Only then can we program the button to light up the LED.
We do this by checking if the button is pressed or not (add debounce). If so, we light up a new LED each time the button is pressed. 
```
LSL R6, #1               @ Shift left (no effect when R6=0 initially)
ORR R6, #0x00000100      @ Add the new rightmost LED (PE8)
STR R6, [R5]             @ Store updated pattern
```
To light up the neighboring LED, we perform a left shift operation and a bitmask or so that the LED stays on even when the bit is shifted.
Keep on looping until it reaches the maximum amount of LEDs (8) then stop.

### 2.c




### 2.d
In this exercise, we can seperate our code into 3 modules:
* Checking Letters
* Button
* LEDs

#### Checking Letters
We define an ascii string which has been stored in register R1. We then use 2 registers to keep track of the vowel and consonant count. 
To check for vowels/consonants, we simply iterate through the string and compare if the current letter is equal to a vowel/consonant. If so, we increase the count and loop back until the string has ended.
NOTE THAT THE COUNT IS IN BINARY!

#### Button
The button acts as a mode switch. Initially, the mode is set to show vowels so if we press the button, the mode will change to show consonants.

#### LEDs
```
STRB R5, [R6, #ODR +1]  		@ Show vowel count on LEDs
STRB R3, [R6, #ODR +1]  		@ Show consonant count on LEDs
```
Here, we have #ODR + 1 because the bit location for the LEDs are located on bits 8-15 therefore we need to add the offset.





## Exercise 3
### 3.a
In this exercise we can seperate our code into two modules:
* Checking the status of the button
* Transmitting the string

#### Checking the status of the button
The program checks whether the button is being pressed. If not, it cycles checking again and again, until it detects that it is being pressed. If it detects it is pressed it reads the button state again until it detects the button has been released. It then returns to the main function so the string can be transmitted.
```
check_button:
    LDR R0, =GPIOA			@ Load GPIOA address into R0 (button bit)
poll_press:
    LDR R3, [R0, #GPIO_IDR]   		@ Read button state (0 = not pressed, 1 = pressed)
    TST R3, #1               		@ Check if PA0 is pressed (bit if button)
    BEQ poll_press            		@ Keep polling if not pressed 

poll_release:
    LDR R3, [R0, #GPIO_IDR]   		@ Read button state again
    TST R3, #1                		@ Check if PA0 is still pressed
    BNE poll_release          		@ Wait until button is released

    BX LR				@ Go back to the main flow (load_message)
```

#### Transmitting the string
The program copies the memory address of the string we want to transmit into register R1. It then loads each byte (character) into the UART transmit one-by-one with a slight delay to keep the process stable checking each time that the transmit buffer is empty (the character has been successfully transmitted) before it sends the next one. Once it detects the null terminator in the string (signifying the end), it copies the memory address of the terminating character into R1 and loads this byte/character into the UART transmit before returning to the main function and looping through the whole program again.
```
load_message:
	LDR R1, =message           	@ Load address of message
	transmit_loop:
		LDRB R5, [R1], #1	@ Loads the char into R5 and post increment R1 by 1
		CMP R5, #0		@ Check if it's end of string
		BEQ end_loop		@ Branch to end loop if null terminator detected
		B uart_loop		@ If not end of string, continue the transmission

end_loop:
	LDR R0, =terminating_char	@ Set R0 to the terminating char
	LDRB R5, [R0]			@ Get the byte of the terminating char
	poll_end:
		LDR R0, =UART			@ Get address of UART 
		LDR R3, [R0, USART_ISR]		@ Read the UART status register
		ANDS R3, #1 << UART_TXE		@ Check if TX buffer is empty (ready to transmit)
		BEQ poll_end			@ If not empty, keep on checking

		STRB R5, [R0, USART_TDR]	@ Transmit the terminating character 
		B main_flow			@ Restart the whole process (wait for button input)

uart_loop:
	LDR R0, =UART				@ Get address of UART

	poll_uart:				
		LDR R3, [R0, USART_ISR]		@ Read the UART status register

		ANDS R3, #1 << UART_TXE		@ Check if TX bufer is empy (ready to transmit)
		BEQ uart_loop			@ If not empty, keep on checking

		STRB R5, [R0, USART_TDR]	@ Transmit the current character
		BL delay_loop			@ Delay to make the transmission stable
		B transmit_loop			@ Loop the transmission process

@ Basic delay function following the lecture
delay_loop:
	LDR R9, =0xfffff 			@ Arbitrary value (should be large enough)
delay_inner:
	SUBS R9, #1
	BGT delay_inner
	BX LR
```

### 3.b



### 3.c
This code involved uncommenting a line from the Week 3 UART example code to call a function defined in initialise.s to change the clock speed to six times faster than before (from 8MHz to 48MHz). 
```
@ step 2, now the clock is HSE, we are allowed to switch to PLL
	@ clock is set to External clock (external crystal) - 8MHz, can enable the PLL now
	LDR R1, [R0, #RCC_CFGR] @ load the original value from the enable register
	LDR R2, =1 << 20 | 1 << PLLSRC | 1 << 22 @ the last term is for the USB prescaler to be 1
	ORR R1, R2  @ set PLLSRC (use PLL) and PLLMUL to 0100 - bit 20 is 1 (set speed as 6x faster)
				@ see page 140 of the large manual for options
				@ NOTE: cannot go faster than 72MHz)
	STR R1, [R0, #RCC_CFGR] @ store the modified enable register values back to RCC
```

The same baud rate must be maintained for the computer to continue to be able to communicate with the microcontroller through the UART. We are over sampling by 16 so use the equation:
<img width="278" alt="Screenshot 2025-03-25 at 10 47 56â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e225650-711f-470f-af53-e7ecac45787b" />

Our desired baud rate is 115,200. Previously, this gave USARTDIV = 8,000,000 / 115,200 = 0x46, with the new clock speed we get USARTDIV = 48,000,000 / 115,200 = 0x1A1.
```
@ this is the baud rate
@MOV R1, #0x46 @ from our earlier calculations (for 8MHz), store this in register R1
MOV R1, #0x1A1 @ From calculation for clock at 48MHz
```
